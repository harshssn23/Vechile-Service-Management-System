# Vechile-Service-Management-System
A two-wheeler service shop wants to develop a system to regulate the maintenance of their day-to-day services.
Every incoming vehicle must be
assigned a job card. The card should have various details such as
registration number, owner details, engine number, type of service
needed, and expected delivery date. Further information to be filled in the
job card varies as per the service type (Ex: maintenance, oil service,
brake condition etc.). On completing the vehicle service, the job card has
to be updated, and the system has to alert the owner automatically. The
job's priority is fixed based on specific criteria like delivery date, and a
service mechanic gets the list of jobs for the day.
